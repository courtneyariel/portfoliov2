			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				The Barnes and Noble College(BNC) app was a project I worked on for two weeks at DESIGNATION Labs. The app’s main capability was to help students buy textbooks for classes and improve overall involvement on campus. Due to the app being difficult to use and plagued with poor design choices the user base was minimal. I was responsible for creating the user interface from the wireframes the UX team created.</p>

	<h1>Understanding the UX</h1>
	<p>
		To start off the project I first analyzed the current app to understand the pain points of current users and the client.</p>

<div class="oldapp">
	<img src="img/bnc/onb.jpg">

	<img src="img/bnc/signup.jpg">
	<img src="img/bnc/home.jpg">
	<img src="img/bnc/nav.jpg">


</div>



<p>Customer Pain Points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- User onboarding is difficult, leading to a high barrier of entry</li>

<li>- The app currently has little to no utility.</li> 
<li>- The only features include: push notifications for marketing, order tracking for orders placed on the website</li>
<li>- You must leave the app to purchase books on the app</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<p>Company Pain Points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- Low user base</li>
<li>- Limited user engagement</li>
<li>- No data available for insights, marketing</li>

</ul>

<h1>Wireframes</h1>

<p>
	I then studied the wireframes created by the UX team to get an understanding of the new direction the app was going to take.
</p>

<div class="bncwire">

	<a href="img/bnc/wireframes.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/bnc/wireframes.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>
	The UX team improved the overall user flow for ordering books and managing your account. From their research they decided including news about the school and including campus events would involve engage more students to use the app.
</p>

<p>
	After having a better idea of the project I also contacted the client to dicuss the UI design direction. His main requirements were that the design attracted students, alumni, and parents.

<section class="mweb margintop">


<h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>

<p>
	I conducted a competitive analysis to understand our competitors and their user interface.</p>
	<p>

<a href="img/bnc/ca.png" target="_blank"><img src ="img/bnc/ca.png"></a>
<br>
Here is what I collected from this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>- There is currently no app exactly like BNC</li>
<li>- Other competitors are online bookstores that are white washed leaving almost all the university bookstores websites to look identical except for the change in university colors.</li>
<li>- Amazon is beginning to partner with colleges for selling textbooks so I took this into account on how BNC could be unique from them.</li>
</ul>


	</section>






<section class="margintop">
<h1>Style Tiles</h1>

	<p>
		I started off by creating a style tile using colors from a university associated with BNC. With students being the main users of the app, I decided that going with a modern look following current design trends would appeal to them the most since they are avid and savvy technology users.
</p>

<div class="styletile">

<a href="img/bnc/styletile.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/bnc/styletile.jpg"></a>
</div>

		<p>

I showed my style tile and a few screens to the client. The client asked for more imagery in the design and suggested to try using gaussian blur effects with dark overlays. I was originally concerned about the fact that the app would be white-washed but the client told me to not worry about that and to keep exploring designs.


	</p>

	<p>
		 I then created this style tile that has a clean feel and incorporated thin iconography to go with the design I had in mind. 

	<div class="styletile">
		<a href="img/bnc/styletile2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/bnc/styletile2.jpg"></a>
	</div>

</section>

<div class="ui">
<h1>High Fidelity Mockups</h1>

<p>
	Here are some of the screens I made for the app at the end of the two weeks.
	I included the gaussian blur image effects in the background and included more of the university’s imagery throughout the app. I also changed my design from thick and big iconography to thin and smaller. I thought this overall looked more like current design trends, it felt cleaner, and would it appeal to our targeted demographic.
